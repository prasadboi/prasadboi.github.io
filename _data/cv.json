Orchestrated data/tensor/pipeline parallelism across 2×A100s; doubled throughput (337→169 min) and cut per-GPU memory up to ~48%. Packaged modular Trainer scripts and SLURM workflows to automate QLoRA (pplx 7.996) and multi-GPU runs (pplx 14.36–22.97)."

Reduced eval loss from 2.38 to 0.60 via staged training, transfer learning, and cosine LR scheduling; stabilized convergence on small custom datasets. Achieved reproducible experiments with automated logging, checkpointing, and visualization."

Benchmarked KNN, SVR, MLP, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, CNN+SVR, and a custom neural-SVR with dynamically scaled ε-insensitive loss and trend-alignment penalty; evaluated with MSE and R². Delivered state-of-the-art results with custom-loss neural-SVR (MSE 28.05; R² 0.998); improved trend interpretability via OFI features."
