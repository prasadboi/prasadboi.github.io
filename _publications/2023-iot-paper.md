permalink: /publication/2023-iot-paper
excerpt: 'We propose a context-aware behavioral fingerprinting of IoT devices that takes into account the circumstances or contexts under which the devices are operating. Our fingerprinting strategy uses supervised learning for classifying the IoT devices.Finally, Experimental results show that our fingerprinting technique is quite effective and is capable of identifying IoT devices with more than 94% accuracy.'
