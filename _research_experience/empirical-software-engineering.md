## Empirical Software Engineering: Identifying Bug-Prone Java Files via Metrics

### Description

- Implemented scripts to extract **18 source-code metrics** (e.g., coupling, complexity via **CKJM**) and **7 change metrics** (e.g., LOC added/deleted) from **835+ SVN diffs**.  
- Trained **scikit-learn** classifiers that achieved **>91% accuracy** at flagging bug-prone files, which **guided Agile policy updates** and reduced post-release defects.  
- Automated the **metrics pipeline** and addressed **multicollinearity**, improving reproducibility and model reliability across iterations.

**Stack:** Java, Python, scikit-learn, SVN
