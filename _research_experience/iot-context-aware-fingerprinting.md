## Context-Aware Behavioral Fingerprinting for IoT Devices

### Description

- Collected & analyzed **600K+ packets** (Wireshark); engineered **18 packet-level features** (e.g., TCP window size, payload entropy).
- Achieved **~94% accuracy** via **Random Forest** for device identification in variable contexts.
- Deployed an **IoT testbed** (Raspberry Pi gateway + 8 NodeMCU nodes), lowering per-device cost by **~90%** vs prior setups.

**Stack:** Python, C, Raspberry Pi, NodeMCU, scikit-learn, Wireshark
