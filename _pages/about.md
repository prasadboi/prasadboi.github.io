Hi! I am Arjun Parasuram Prasad, a graduate student at the NYU Agentic Lab advised by Prof. Mengye Ren. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Search, and ML Systems.

Previously, I was a Data Analytics Engineer at Providence Health Care, where I built ETL pipelines and analytics frameworks to track marketing-analytics metrics. I also have experience as a Machine Learning Intern at SuperPe.in, where I developed an OCR pipeline and a multi-agent and RAG enabled chatbot to automate customer query resolution.
