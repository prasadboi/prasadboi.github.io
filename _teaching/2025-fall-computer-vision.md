### Overview
Course Assistant and Grader for the Computer Vision course (40 students) held by Prof. Davi Geiger. Over the duration of this course I have developed assignments covering CNN development from scratch, Vision Transformers, and Object Tracking algorithms with the intention of providing strong foundations in Computer Vision concepts, PyTorch, and Huggingface.
